# Applied-Analytics-in-Python
Python codes of my machine learning models as part of my Applied Analytics coursework in Statistics department


Applied Analytics is an extensive coursework provided by Statistics department of Texas A&M University providing hands-on knowledge on Python and SAS of various machine learning algorithms. As a part of coursework, each week a task was assigned to execute a particular algorithm on a given dataset and present the results. This repository is a collection of these codes and datasets that helped me long way in devloping my coding skills in Python and grasp more confidence on my machine learning skills.

The Repository contains my work on following algorithms/skills.

1. Exploraroy Data Analysis
2. Linear Regression
3. Logistic Regression
4. Decision Trees
5. Neural Netowrks
6. Random Forests
7. Rare Evenst modeling/ Imbalance Classification
